## About the Book
Spring 5.0 is due to arrive with a myriad of new and exciting features that will change the way we’ve used the framework so far. This book will show you this evolution—from solving the problems of testable applications to building distributed applications on the cloud.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1, 4, and 12 does not have code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
<properties>
    <mockito.version>1.10.20</mockito.version>
</properties>
```

To be able to run examples from this book, you will need the following tools:

Java 8
Eclipse IDE
Postman

We will use Maven embedded into Eclipse IDE to download all the dependencies that are needed.
